# Go Webserver
This project is to experiment with webserver functionality of Go

## Running the code
The code will execute and run on port 1111 (in future this may change)

## CURL example
You can check the output of this by running the following CURL command when the webserver is running
`curl http://localhost:1111 --header "x-example-id: 123abc"`
